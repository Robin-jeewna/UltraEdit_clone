## UltraEdit Clone

This project is a frontend clone of the UltraEdit text editor.  
I built it by following [CodeWithHarry](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeWithHarry)'s YouTube tutorial using:

- HTML
- CSS

### Features:
- Responsive design
- Clean UI
- Functional layout similar to UltraEdit

> Note: This is a frontend-only educational project for practice purposes.
